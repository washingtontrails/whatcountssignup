Description

	WhatCounts Signup is a simple Plone Product that provides site visitors
	the opportunity to sign up for a WhatCounts-hosted email list.  It comes
	with an email signup portlet and a fuller signup page that requests
	basic contact information.  The person is signed up to the email list
	and a copy of the contact information is sent on to an organizational
	contact. 
	
Installation

    **In keeping with Python and Zope 3 conventions, this Product's package should
 	be named "whatcountssignup", with all lowercase letters.  The Product is generally
 	referred to as WhatCounts Signup though.**
	
	Place the whatcountssignup package in the Products directory of your Zope instance
    and restart the server.  The product is then installable in the ZMI's quick
 	installer or in Plone's Add/Remove Products in the Control Panel.

	You may uninstall from the same location, although, the uninstall process
	doesn't remove skin directories or the email_signup_property sheet in 
	portal_properties.
